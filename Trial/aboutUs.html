                        <p>A few years ago, I took an 8 week course on the basics of programming languages, which gave me an idea of HTML and some CSS. After finishing my Leaving Cert, I came to Griffith College to study Computer Science. Myself and Zainab met regularly to work on this assignment together, to ensure a cohesive, conistent idea and design for this website.</p>
                        <p>For this project, we first discussed between us what type of website we had in mind. It was initally a more bussines style of site, but after consideration, we fell back on a wiki style of website, with some JavaScript pages included rather than the focus.</p>
                        <p>We aimed to maximise each of our participation in coding the HTML, CSS and JS. The CSS was also based on the designs and ideas we proposed. In the analysis document we have included the wireframe that I designed prior to beginning the project.</p>
                        <p>Knowing the general idea of our website, we begun coding our HTML and the basic CSS. I opted for writing in all the Lore and information as we found that I have more knowledge overall about the game. I wrote about the lore, different strategies etc., about every boss in our webpage. So my main focus was the HTML, with some influence on the ideas behind the CSS. We worked on the JS together in person.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>Summary</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proposed the design of our website.</li>
                            <li>Wrote in the lore and bosses pages.</li>
                            <li>Co-operation in writing CSS.</li>

                        <p>After graduating from Secondary school in 2021, i was able to pursue my passions in Computer Science, with the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. I really enjoyed working this project with my partner Eric, he and I co-operated very well in every part of the project.</p>
                        <p> 8 months into Computer Science degree, i realise that web development is an area that peaked my interest.</p>
                        <p>We chose this topic, as we both love video games. However, Eric is especially keen on FromSoftware games, hence the choice, "Dark Souls"</p>
                        <p>The color scheme is fairly similar to the game. The dark theme of our website complements the actual theme of the game. As the game incorporates an almost horror theme, we decided on mostly dim colours with some splashes of light colors to add a sense of calmness. </p>
                        <p>We opted to use many grids in our CSS and we collaborated on creating a user-friendly webpage. Through the navigation bar that I created, we made clicking through the different pages much easier. </p>

                        <ul>
