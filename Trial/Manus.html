                    <h2>Lore</h2>  
                    <p>Within the magical walls of Oolacile, in charge of advancing the knowledge of all spells, incantations and sorcery of the world, they would become convinced by a strange serpent (Kaarth), to begin experimenting on the people of Oolacile. Here, they would take a man to the depths of their tower. They would begin experimenting, pushing him to his limit. The man held a pendant close, in whcih he took solice in. The witches in charge of overseeing the prisoner, would rid the man of this pendant. A strong, cold aura could be felt around him by those who would torture him. Eventually, the man would punch against his cell wall. And again. And again. And again until the wall had formed cracks. He continued to test his might against what could be the wall keeping him from freedom. It was here that would later be known as the entrance into the Abyss.
                    <p>It is unknown if the man in question is Manus, or if he simply awakened Manus from his slumber after he had broken the wall. Regardless of this, the downfall of Oolacile had begun. The humanity of Manus would seep from the chasm of his abyss, corrupting all the citizens, sorcerers and witches included, in the town of Oolacile. He would challenge the power and might of Gwyn if given the chance. His darkness could be felt across the lands.</p>
                    <p>Manus, now known as the Father of the Abyss, would be challenged by the legendary Artorias, the only mortal being who ould walk into the abyss, and not succumb to its corrupted nature. Manus would be defeated by the hero, but Artorias would shortly succumb to his wounds after their fight.</p>
                    <p>If Manus had not been defeated at Oolacile, he would have brought about the "Age of Dark" much sooner than prophesied.</p>

                    <h3>Strategies</h3>
                    <h4>Moveset and Mechanics</h4>
                    <p>It is important before the fight, to obtain the mysterious pendant that can be found in the chest, hidden in the tavern of Oolacile. This item can be used to repel a devastating combo that Manus will unleash half way through the fight.</p>
                    <p>Manus' moveset is very close range focused, with only oneattack he can do from distance. If the player is far enough away, Manus will jump, doing a slam attack with his fist that has a large hitbox. Once closer to Manus however, he can do a variety of attacks. His most deadly combo can be telegraphed by him seemingly screaming with his hands open. This will let the player know his combo attack is about to begin. He will start with a qucik sweep attack, followed by a back hand sweep, an attack that then launches the player into the air, before slamming them back down. If caught in this attack, a player with less than 30 vigor will die. He also has a fist slam attack, along with some normal swipe attacks back and forth.</p>
                    <p>His main attack that is lethal if not dealt with correclty, is  his large AOE humanity attack, which will start out from Manus himself, shooting out in a circular area, which will then be pulled back in, before Manus then shoots a focused attack of humanity sprites from his staff at the player. This is were the mysterious pendant will be used. Upon activating the pendant, the player will do a short AOE attack of their own, which will push the humanity sprites away, negating any damage that woud otherwise be dealt. This needs to be done 2-3 times, as the attacks can be dodged, however due to the fast nature of the follow ups, it is recommened to only dodge the first initial AOE burst that comes from Manus. Both the pull back attack and staff attack should be countered using the pendant, as they will do a large chunk of damage.</p>
                    <p>While there is no optimal strategy to play, as Manus' attacks have a range of blockable and dodgable moves, it is best to stick towards his left side (right side facing him) as this will avoid most of his combo openings as he will likely use his right hand to start them.</p>
                    <p>Weaknesses:
                        <ul>
                            <li>None</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Resistances:

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manus may be named after Mannus, the father of mankind in Germanic mythology.</li>
                        <li>Along with his name, it is also theorized that Manus was the original holder of the fourth Lord Soul. Along with Gwyn who had the Soul of Light, Nito the Soul of Death, The Witches of Izalith who possesed the Soul of Life, Manus might have possesed the Soul of Dark (The soul of man). We know that Gwyn split his Lord Soul into fragments among Seath and the Four Kings, so it is not so far fetched to believe Manus shared his Dark Soul will all of man.</li>
                        <li>It is also theorized that Ciaran, an assassin and one of the four knights of Gwyn was given the mission to assassinate Manus before the events of the corruption of Oolacile.</li>
