                    <h2>Lore</h2>  
                    <p>The Four Kings, granted a piece of Gwyns Lord Soul each, assigned to rule over New Londo, where said to be benevolent rulers. There land prospered in the light, with honorary knights who fought in the war against the dragons. However this prosperity did not last long, as it is said that the Four Kings had unearthed a great power of evil buried beneath New Londo.</p>
                    <p>Promised by a serpent (Kaarth) of the darkness of immortality, the Four Kings learned the art of life stealing. A unknown and later forbidden magic that would steal the life of another, to prolong the users own life. Feeding on their own citizens to gain more life and power, only few knights were entrusted with this technique passed onto them by the Four Kings.</p>
                    <p>The Four Kings would later battle against the legendary Artorias, and after being sealed away, would reside deep within the abyss of New Londo. Some of their Dark Wraith knights can be found throughout the players journey of the game.</p>

                    <h3>Strategies</h3>
                    <h4>Moveset and Mechanics</h4>
                    <p>Once the player drops into the arena, one of the Four Kings will spawn. Note that the arena is a pitch black void, so judging the distance plays a big part in the fight. The boss has large AOE attacks that will be lethal to players, and want to avoid being hit. It is telegraphed by the King hugging itself, with its weapon sheathed. If the player is attacking the King as this happens, it's recommended to have a high magic resistant shield to block the AOE as you wont be able to run away fast enough.</p>
                    <p>If the player is too far away from the King, they will do two attacks. One of these attacks is a dash-grab attack which will certainly kill low vigor players. This can be easily dodged by running away from the king as they charge. The second attack is a large magical projectile that the king will shoot from their shoulder. While not fast or leathal, this attack has a long seek time before disappearing, so it is recommened that the player tank the shot with their high magic resistant shield.</p>
                    <p>Close range attacks of the Kings is their weakest aspect. Their attack consists of a downward left and right consecutive swing, an AOE spinning attack, and a standard slash attack.</p>
                    <p>The main mechanic for this fight is multiple Kings will spawn if the player does not kill one fast enough. This can lead to a total of four Kings in the arena t once. Each Kings health is arounda quarter of the total health bar. It's recommened to run a high poise build, with a high magic resistant shield, and the pyromancy spell of "Power Within" and "Flash Sweat", in order to tank the bosses hits and burst down the bosses as fast as possible.</p>
                    <p>Weaknesses:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fire</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Resistances:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>None</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Note: While only weak towards fire, magic also performs great against damaging the Kings.</p>
