                        Black Dragon Kalameet is one of the last everlasting dragons remaining in the world. Not much is known of Kalameet, however he is feared by even the most bravest of knights and dragon slayers. One of which would be Hawkeye Gough, an archer who never misses his mark, and a member of the four knights of Gwyn. Gough was assigned to help knights in hunting down the remaining dragons, yet has met his match in Kalameet. He posseses the immortal scales of the dragons, but differs in the fact that he has special abilities not seen elsewhere. Kalameet only has one eye, but this eye has the power telekinetically move objects. His fire is also a tainted black flame that melts away the toughest of armor. He resides flying high over Oolacile after its collapse.</p><p>Here the player can encounter Gough in a watch tower just on the outer rim of the city, and ask for aid in defeating the dragon. With Gough disabling the dragons ability to fly and escape, the player is left to face Kalameet in the basin of Oolacile.

                    <h3>Strategies</h3>
                    <h4>Moveset and Mechanics</h4>
                    <p>Kalameet has a wide range of lethal, fast attacks. Upon entering the arena, Kalameet will land opposite of the player. He will normally swoop towards the player in a straight motion with his nose forward. He can also decide to fly up, and cover half the arena in black fire. Both of these attacks are difficult to dodge, with the sweeping attack being a little bit more forgiven. It's recommended to block both of these attacks with a high physical/fire resistant shield. Later in the boss fight, if there is enough distance between the player and Kalameet, he will do a barrage of sweep attacks, however these have a more fogiving dodge time on them.</p>
                    <p>Once close to Kalameet, his attacks range from large sweeping attacks, to direct piercing strikes. Two of his most popular moves are his nose attack, which is triggered when the player is directly in front of Kalameets face. He will pull his head back, indicating the attack. His second move is his slam attacks with his legs. He will lift his right leg into the air and slam down, following up with his left hand and even sometimes his nose attack afterwards. If the player is behind him, he can do another set of two attacks. He will either swipe his tail while turning to face the player in a single motion, or he will slam his tail three different times trying to hit the player.</p>
                    <p>Kalameet has some special moves though that can only be triggered at certain angles of play. One of these is somewhat easy to trigger, but if the player is underneath Kalameet, he will stand on his hind legs, and do an AOE fire attack that covers the ground around him. His most special attack, is his telekinetic grab. This attack has a low percent to trigger, however if it does, Kalameet again will stand up on his hind legs while his eye glows, making a loud screech like noise, that if it hits the player, doesnt do significant damage, but will add a debuff which makes the player take double damage for the remained of the fight. It is important to not get caught in this attack no matter what. The attack is also unblockable, so the player will need to gain distance on Kalameet, or run behind him to avoid getting caught.</p>
                    <p>The best strategy is to stay somewhat behind on of Kalameets front legs, or close to his head. This will avoid most AOE attacks, baiting out his most punishable moves. The player should focus on attacking his head when he does his nose attack, otherwise focus on his front legs as much as possible.</p>

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Dark Souls 2, Kalameets scales are used as armor for the Dragon Knights, who protect the Ancient Dragon.</li>
                        <li>If you kill him without Goughs help, the player will receive special dialogue.</li>
                        <li>It is theorized that Kalameet was corrupted by the abyss, akin to Darkeater Midir in Dark Souls 3. The signs of this are his oily dark scales, and his fire breath causes physical damage, just like all abyssal sorceries.</li>
