                    <h2>Lore</h2>  
                    <p>Artorias, a key member and second in command of "The Proud Knights of Gwyn", which consisted of only 4 members, was instrumental in the war agaisnt the eternal dragons, during the "Age of Dragons". He would go on to become famous for his swordsmanship. Becoming dubbed as the greatest fighter during the "Age of Light", unmatched with a greatsword.</p>
                    <p>During the "Age of Light", with no dragons left to hunt and extinguish, Gwyn gave each of his knights key roles in sustaining his reign across the land, with arguably the most central role given to Artorias. He was given the task to hold back against the creeping "Age of Dark" set to be brought by the pigmy of man. While not immediately pressed by the threat of the dark, it would become more apparent that the "Age of Light" was destined to end.</p>
                    <p>The first true threat, posed in the land of New Londo, a city named after the capital of Anor Londo, would see a myserious serpant, said to be a disciple of the dark itself, would press the Four Kings, who ruled over the land, into a deal of immortality, for the life of their citizens. Artorias, sent out alone would face this threat.</p>
                    <p>In what is lost in legend, it is said that Artorias gained power to walk in the abyss of New londo unscathe, and unharmed. While he did not defeat the Four Kings, he was successful in holding them and the spread of the darkness back long enough for the city to be sealed away, flooded to the highest of rooftops. It was here that he earned his nickname, Artorias "The Abyss Walker".</p>
                    <p>It wasnt until the second, and penultimate catasrophy that would arise in the land of Oolacile, said to be the land of incantations and magic, that another threat would show itself, that being the Father of the Abyss, Manus. Again, Artorias, sent out with his companion Sif, to hold agaisnt the pressing of the Dark.</p>
                    <p>Legends say Artorias stormed Oolacile, defeating the corrupted citizens of Oolacile all the way up until the presipice of what can only be described as a gateway into the land itself. An Abyss, so deep, light could not be found in any corners. In a battle said to have shaken the great land of Gwyn itself, from Izalith to Anor Londo, Artorias defeated Manus, the Father of the Abyss, at the cost of his own life. His companion Sif, was left with the shield of Artorias, enhanced with a magic powerful enough to repel agaisnt corrupted souls, was the only survivor. Sif would later go on to pledge his life, watching over the grave of his best friend Artroias, coveting Artorias' legendary power and knowledge of abyss walking. Artorias would leave behind such a big legend, he inspired a legion dubbed after him, to sacrifice their lifes in honor of fighting the "Age of Dark".</p>

                    <h3>Strategies</h3>
                    <h4>Moveset and Mechanics</h4>
                    <p>Artorias, equiped with his legendary greatsword, consists of large sweeping attacks, and closing-distance attacks.</p> <p>It's best to keep on either his left or right side, as backing away will trigger either his leaping attack which will consist of 3-4 straight forward, lock on attacks that can be dodged with i-frames, or by dodging to the left or right. His other attack is telegraphed when his greatsword arm leans back, leading to a fast, high damage piercing attack which can be difficult to evade if at mid range. </p>
                    <p>At close range, if rotating to the right, he will have a quick, small area attack that splashes the player with darkness, dealing little damage. Rotating left can also trigger his leaping attack. If the player rotates to the left, he will do a sweeping attack with his greatsword that deals high damage if caught out, but can be easily dodged with very forgiving i-frames on his swing.</p>
                    <p>Normal attacks that can trigger when close to Artorias consists of the basic moveset of greatswords, with a back and forth swing, and a heavy attack that can launch the player upwards, in a stun-like affect.</p>
                    <p>The Main mechanic of this fight, is Artorias' power up, which is telegraphed by him stopping in place, with darkness enroaching his body. The player can stop this by consistently damaging him while he is trying to charge. This charge up can be read early if the player is close to Artorias, and he starts to dodge away from the player. If he is allowed to power up, he will become a lot more aggressive, and his attacks will deal extra damage. He will also speed up in his attacks and wind-ups. It is best to avoid letting him enter this phase.</p>
